HCommander
=================

Most Hadoop jobs (mapreduce or not) are launched from command line. As a consequence, building a clean command line parser is a must. [JCommander](http://jcommander.org) does almost everything you would ever want. But it does not know, out of the box, about the Hadoop world in general and about [ToolRunner](http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/api/org/apache/hadoop/util/ToolRunner.html) in particular. HCommander bridges the gab for you.

At the moment, you will need to build the package yourself.

Soon : example of use.
